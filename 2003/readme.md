# Rapid environment building Prototypes Examples.

designed for easier, text editor, development. The protos themselves make intelligent assumptions for their, more specific, use cases. 

* [Voxel](blocks/) various grids with intelligent self-texturing. (one voxel can alter whole objects texture mapping.)

* [Landscape](surface/) surface procedural generation, includes height based colours with ability to auto-locating objects on the surface.

* [Tubes](cylinder/) regular polygon self-colouring, in rings, extrusions.
