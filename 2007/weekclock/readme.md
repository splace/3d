Clock in base seven, rather than twelve, so days of the week are unified in one clock face with only three hands.

# Telling the time

the clock face has 7 'day' divisions each sub-divided by 7 (indicated by inward pointing triangles).

above image has its *Short* hand tell you its Thursday evening, just past 1.5 long hand rotations to midnight,
and its *Long* hand telling you, more precisely, that it's slightly more than 1.25 long hand rotations to midnight.

this would conventionally be written as;

	Thu 19∶47∶41 (in base 7 base 24:base 60:base 60)

or sensibly here as; 

	421431 (all base 7)

## The Hands

- **Short** :- 1 rotation a week (week day glyphs shown)
notice the triangle brightness shows day/night.
- **Long** :- 7 rotations a day.(49 times faster)
- **Thin** :- 343 (7x7x7) rotations a day.(49 times faster again)

## Conversions to base 12 clock:

- one rotation of the *Short* hand a week.
- one rotation of the *Long* hand 1/7 day ~ 3.5 hours.
- one rotation of *Thin* hand ~ 4 mins.
- move by a 'day' division for *Short* hand a day.
- move by a 'day' division for *Long* hand ~ 0.5 an hour.
- move by a 'day' division for *Thin* hand ~ 0.5 a minute.
- move by a triangle for *Short* hand ~ 3.5 hours. (as complete rotation of *Long* hand)
- move by a triangle for *Long* hand ~ 4 minutes. (as complete rotation of *Thin* hand)
- move by a triangle for *Thin* hand ~ 5 secs.

## Zero value

because a day is divided by an odd number, midnight and midday can't both be with the long hand in the same place.
here midday is chosen to be straight up and so is represented, digitally, by zero.
this means midnight occurs with the long hand straight down.
