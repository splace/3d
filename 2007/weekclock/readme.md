Clock in base seven, rather than twelve, so days of the week are unified in one clock face with only three hands.

# Telling the time

the clock face has 7 'day' divisions each sub-divided by 7 (indicated by inward pointing triangles).

above image has its *Short* hand tell you its Thursday evening, just past 1.5 long hand rotations to midnight,
and its *Long* hand telling you, more precisely, that it's slightly more than 1.25 long hand rotations to midnight.

conventionally this is written as;

	Thu 19∶47∶41 (number bases:- 7 24:60:60)

but here, sensibly, as; 

	421431 (simply base 7)

## The Hands

- **Short** :- 1 rotation a week (week day glyphs shown)
notice the triangle brightness shows day/night.
- **Long** :- 7 rotations a day.(49 times faster)
- **Thin** :- 343 (7x7x7) rotations a day.(49 times faster again)

## Conversions to base 12 clock:

- one full rotation:-
	of the *Short* hand a week.
	of the *Long* hand 1/7 day ~ 3.5 hours.
	of the *Thin* hand ~ 4 mins.
- rotation by a 'day' division:-
	of the *Short* hand a day.
	of the *Long* hand ~ half an hour.
	of the *Thin* hand ~ half a minute.
- rotation by a triangle
	of the *Short* hand ~ 3.5 hours. (same as full rotation of *Long* hand)
	of the *Long* hand ~ 4 minutes. (same as full rotation of *Thin* hand)
	of the *Thin* hand ~ 5 secs.

## Zero value

because a day is divided by an odd number, midnight and midday can't both be with the long hand in the same place.
here midday is chosen to be straight up, digitally represented by zero.(not midnight)
and midnight occurs with the long hand straight down.
