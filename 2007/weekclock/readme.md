# telling the time

clock face has 7 'day' divisions each sub-divided by 7 triangles.

above is showing (Thu 19∶47∶41)

	the Short hand tells you its Thursday evening just past 1.5 long hand rotations to midnight
	and the Long hand shows, more accurately, that its slightly more than 1.25 long hand rotations to midnight.

	digitally:

	421431 (base 7) == Thu 19∶47∶41 (base 7 base 24:base 60:base 60)

## Hands

* short:- 1 rotation a week (week day glyphs shown)
notice the triangle brightness shows day/night.
* long :- 7 rotations a day.
* thin :- 343 (7x7x7) rotations a day.

## Conversions to base 12 clock:

* short hand: each triangle 1/7 day or just under 3.5 hours.
* long hand: each rotation, also 1/7 day.
* long hand: each 'day' division about 0.5 an hour.
* thin hand: each rotation about 4 mins.
* thin hand: each triangle about 5 secs.

## Zero value

	because a day is divided by an odd number, midnight and midday can't both be with the long hand straight up.
	here midday is used and so is represented, digitally, by zero.
	this means midnight occurs with the long hand straight down.
