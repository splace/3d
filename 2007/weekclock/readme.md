Clock based on base seven, rather than twelve, so days of the week are unified in one clock face with only three hands.

# Telling the time

the clock face has 7 'day' divisions each sub-divided by 7 (indicated by inward pointing triangles).

so the Short hand tells you its Thursday evening just past 1.5 long hand rotations to midnight
and the Long hand shows, more precisely, that it is slightly more than 1.25 long hand rotations to midnight.

this would conventionally be written as;

	Thu 19∶47∶41 (in base 7 base 24:base 60:base 60)

or sensibly here as; 

	421431 (in base 7)

## The Hands

- **Short** :- 1 rotation a week (week day glyphs shown)
notice the triangle brightness shows day/night.
- **Long** :- 7 rotations a day.
- **Thin** :- 343 (7x7x7) rotations a day.

## Conversions to base 12 clock:

- **Short**: each triangle 1/7 day	 ~ 3.5 hours.
- **Long**: each rotation, also 1/7 day.
- **Long**: each 'day' division		 ~ 0.5 an hour.
- **Thin**: each rotation			 ~ 4 mins.
- **Thin**: each triangle			 ~ 5 secs.

## Zero value

because a day is divided by an odd number, midnight and midday can't both be with the long hand straight up.
here midday is used and so is represented, digitally, by zero.
this means midnight occurs with the long hand straight down.
