# Features

## Arrow vector quantities
	Velocity = Blue (single headed)
	Acceleration = Red (double headed)

## Bullet time
	When calculation takes longer than frame rate, rate is reduced until accurate. 
	A faster PC will produce less Bullet time.
	
## Chaos
	Even though always starting the same, over time the Butterfly Effect results in runs diverging.
